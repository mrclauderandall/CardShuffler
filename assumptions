ASSUMPTIONS

	1) the top card of a deck is the card on the top of the deck when 
	a deck of cards is faced down. This is the card that is dealt first
	in most standard card games such as poker, gofish

	2) when cutting a deck, most people hold the deck in such a way 
	that means they 'count' from bottom to an estimated half way

	3) when cutting a deck, the deck on the right is actually the original
	deck, while the deck on the left is originally empty, and one by one has
	cards from the right (original) deck added to it

	4) it is ok for the top and bottom card to be the same card in a deck 
	with only 1 card in it


NOTES

	1) card 0x is a 'nothing card' that should not appear
