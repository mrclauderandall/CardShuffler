Apparently when using a riffle shuffle, to reach a truly random deck one must shuffle the cards at least 7 times. In this project I wanted to try and test by making some data structures to represent a deck of playing cards, and some algorithms that would replicate a ripple shuffle. 

In short, 7 shuffles should do the trick
